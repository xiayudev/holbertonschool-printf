.TH _PRINTF 3
.SH NAME
_printf \- format and print data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B int _printf(const char *\fIformat\fR, ...);
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf function prints the ARGUMENT(s) passed according to format specifiers given in the \fIformat\fR parameter.
You can pass as many arguments as you want but the specifiers have to match with the number of arguments. You can see more
information in the BUGS section.
.PP
This function works with stdarg.h library that allows us to work with many arguments as we want. It uses \fIva_list\fR, \fIva_arg\fR,
\fIva_start\fR and \fIva_end\fR macros.
.PP
The \fIformat\fR parameter is a character string which contains zero or more format specifiers. A format specifier begins with the character \fB%\fR
followed by a \fIconversion specifier\fR. For now we will cover the specifiers: \fB%c\fR, \fB%s\fR, \fB%%\fR, \fB%d\fR and \fB%i\fR.
Below, the description of each specifier.

.RS
\fB%c\fR Specifier for characters i.e. \fI'c', 'x', 'm'\fR.
.PP
\fB%s\fR Specifier for strings (pointer to char - array of chars) i.e. \fI"Hello", "World!"\fR.
.PP
\fB%%\fR Specifier for percent symbol i.e. \fI"100%%", "My battery is 20%%"\fR.
.PP
\fB%d\fR Specifier for decimal integer (assumes base 10) i.e. \fI21, 100\fR.
.PP
\fB%i\fR Specifier for decimal integer (detects the base automatically) i.e. \fI18, 98\fR.
.RE
.SH RETURN
The return is an int value which represents the number of charactes of the string after all specifiers has been solved.
.SH BUGS
No bugs known. If you found out a bug please make an issue to this repo: https//www.github.com/repo/porject.git
.SH EXAMPLES
When using this function, you have to pass arguments according to the type that a specifier accepts. In the example below you will see how to
use the function properly.

#include "main.h"

\fIchar\fR *name = "Joshua";
\fIchar\fR initial = 'C';
\fIint\fR age = 24;
\fIint\fR year = 'C';

_printf("Hi!, my name is %s. My initial is %c. My battery is 37%%\n", );
_printf("I am %d years old. I was born in %i\n", age, year);

/* The spected output is 1: Hi!, my name is Joshua. My battery is 37% */
/* The spected output is 2: I am 24 years old. I was born in 1998 */
